# mdice (Musician's dice)
An extremely simple twelve-sided dice based on the chromatic scale. Useful for composition, improvisation and fun practice.

## Installation
Clone into your $PATH and make mdice executable with `$ sudo chmod +x mdice`

## Usage
In your terminal, enter `$ mdice <int>` where `<int>` is an optional integer which allows you to specify how many times you want to roll the dice.
This is useful if you want to roll the dice multiple times for sequences or sequential practice (without having to rerun the command every time).
